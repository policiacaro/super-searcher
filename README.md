<=- ABOUT -=>  
A page to search a word on multiple different sites. Useful for spell-checking, definitions, etymology, and more  

<=- USE -=>  
Click on the picture above or go to the link at the top of the page. The button on the left, labelled 'dict', searches your entry with a dictionary. The button on the right, labelled 'wiki', searches your entry on Wikipedia.   

<=- TECHNICAL STUFF -=>  
Both buttons are linked to click events that take the value of the input box and use that data to contact Merriam-Webster or Wikipedia API's. Once the response from their server is received, the page has a 'results' list that gets cleared and renewed every time you search.
